# Based on the exploratory analysis, here's what we've learned about the data and a proposed approach for modeling:
# 
# ## Key Insights from the Data
# 
# 1. **Dataset Overview**:
#    - 187,990 transaction records for 3,999 unique accounts
#    - Date range spans from December 2012 to June 2015 (about 2.5 years)
# 
# 2. **Account Types**:
#    - 10 different kit types, with "Home Comfort Kit" and "Home Starter Kit" being the most common
#    - Home-related kits (75.6%) are much more common than business kits (3.7%)
# 
# 3. **Transaction Patterns**:
#    - Most common transaction type is "Payment" (85.3% of transactions)
#    - Other notable transaction types include "General Discount" (4.1%), "Redemption" (2.7%), and "Initialization" (2.1%)
#    - Some negative transaction values exist (minimum -161,500)
# 
# 4. **Loan Characteristics**:
#    - All loans have the same duration (540 days)
#    - Payment Plan Deposit ranges from 40,000 to 160,000 UGX (median 60,000)
#    - Daily rates range from 1,000 to 3,900 UGX
#    - Total loan values range from 580,000 to 2,266,000 UGX
# 
# 5. **Repayment Behavior**:
#    - The dataset includes completed loans (Payoff), canceled loans, and active loans
#    - Some accounts have negative outstanding balances (overpaid)
#    - Number of days purchased per transaction ranges from -99 to 99
# 
# ## Proposed Modeling Approach
# 
# Given the business context and data characteristics, I shall focus on **predicting repayment behavior** as our primary objective. This aligns with EEA's goal of providing sustainable energy solutions and ensuring exceptional customer experience.
# 
# ### Specific Modeling Tasks:
# 
# 1. **Predicting Loan Completion**: 
#    - Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will successfully complete their loan (payoff vs. cancellation)
#    - This helps identify high-risk customers early
# 
# 2. **Predicting Time-to-Payoff**:
#    - For customers likely to complete their loans, predict how long it will take
#    - This helps with financial planning and resource allocation
# 
# ### Implementation Plan:
# 
# 1. **Data Preparation**:
#    - Create account-level features by aggregating transaction data
#    - Engineer features related to payment behavior (frequency, consistency, etc.)
#    - Handle any missing values or outliers
# 
# 2. **Feature Engineering**:
#    - Payment regularity (variance in time between payments)
#    - Payment amount patterns (average, variance)
#    - Early payment behavior indicators
#    - Kit type and loan size features
# 
# 3. **Modeling Techniques**:
#    - For classification: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
#    - For time prediction: Regression models or survival analysis
#    - Consider time-series approaches for payment pattern prediction
# 
# 4. **Evaluation**:
#    - Use appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression)
#    - Cross-validation to ensure robustness
#    - Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors

account_final_status.head()


# When creating the base account dataframe, we used `first()` after grouping by 'Account ID'. This choice has important implications:
# 
# ## Why We Used `first()`
# 
# When using `first()`, we're capturing the initial characteristics of each account, specifically:
# 
# 1. **Initial Kit Type**: The type of solar kit the customer initially purchased
# 2. **Original Payment Plan Terms**: The deposit amount, daily rate, loan duration, and total loan value as established at account creation
# 
# ## Tradeoffs of Using `first()` vs `last()`
# 
# ### Using `first()` (our current approach):
# 
# **Advantages:**
# - Captures the original contract terms and product selection
# - Represents the starting point of the customer relationship
# - These values are typically stable and established at account creation
# - For most accounts, these values likely don't change throughout the lifecycle
# 
# **Disadvantages:**
# - Misses any changes to the account terms that might have occurred
# - Doesn't reflect upgrades or modifications to the payment plan
# 
# ### If We Used `last()` Instead:
# 
# **Advantages:**
# - Would capture the final state of the account
# - Would reflect any upgrades or changes to kit type
# - Would show the most recent payment terms
# 
# **Disadvantages:**
# - May not represent the initial conditions that influenced repayment behavior
# - Could introduce survivorship bias (only accounts that lasted long enough to be modified would show different values)
# - The final state might be a result of successful repayment rather than a predictor of it
# 
# ## Business Implications
# 
# The choice between `first()` and `last()` depends on what we're trying to predict:
# 
# 1. **For predicting initial loan performance**: `first()` is better because we want to know how initial conditions predict outcomes
# 2. **For understanding account evolution**: `last()` would be more appropriate
# 
# In our case, using `first()` makes more sense because:
# 
# 1. We're trying to predict loan completion based on initial conditions
# 2. We want to identify risk factors at the beginning of the loan
# 3. The payment plan terms are likely established at account creation and rarely change
# 
# A potential enhancement would be to capture both the first and last values and create features that measure changes over time (e.g., "Was the kit upgraded?", "Did the payment terms change?"). This would give us insight into account evolution while still maintaining the initial conditions as baseline predictors.

print(account_df.isnull().sum())


# In[21]:


# Look at our final dataframe
account_df.head()


# Looking at the missing values in our account dataframe, we can see that there are several nulls in the payment-related features. There's a clear pattern to these nulls:
# 
# 1. We have 111 missing values in most payment transaction metrics (`Value of Transaction_count`, `Value of Transaction_mean`, etc.)
# 2. We have 208 missing values in `Value of Transaction_std` and `avg_days_between_payments`
# 
# The reason for these missing values is straightforward:
# 
# 1. **111 accounts have no payment transactions at all** - These are accounts that were initialized but never made any payments. When we filtered the dataframe to only include "Payment" transaction types and then joined it back to the main account dataframe, these accounts had no matching records.
# 
# 2. **208 accounts have only 0 or 1 payment transaction** - Standard deviation (`Value of Transaction_std`) and average days between payments (`avg_days_between_payments`) require at least 2 data points to calculate. Accounts with only 0 or 1 payment transaction don't have enough data to compute these metrics.
# 
# This actually gives us some valuable information for our model:
# - About 111 out of 3,999 accounts (2.8%) never made any payments after initialization
# - An additional 97 accounts (208-111) made exactly 1 payment but never continued
# 
# These are likely early defaulters or customers who abandoned the service very quickly, which could be an important segment for our prediction model.
# 
# To handle these missing values, we should:
# 
# 1. Fill the NaN values with appropriate defaults (like 0 for counts and sums)
# 2. Create a binary feature to indicate accounts with no payments or only one payment
# 3. For metrics like standard deviation and average days between payments, we could use a default value or create separate binary features to indicate missing data

# The Random Forest model has performed exceptionally well with an accuracy of 99.38% and an ROC AUC of 0.9992, which indicates excellent predictive power. Let's analyze these results and the feature importance findings:
# 
# ## Model Performance Analysis
# 
# The classification report shows near-perfect precision and recall:
# - For class 0 (loans not completed): 100% precision and 99% recall
# - For class 1 (loans completed): 98% precision and 100% recall
# 
# This suggests the model is extremely effective at distinguishing between loans that will be completed and those that won't.
# 
# ## Key Predictors of Loan Completion
# 
# Looking at the top 15 features by importance:
# 
# 1. **Payoff** (26.5%): This is somewhat circular as it directly relates to the target variable - accounts with a "Payoff" transaction are by definition completed loans.
# 
# 2. **loan_paid_percentage** (17.1%): The percentage of the loan that has been paid is highly predictive, which makes intuitive sense.
# 
# 3. **repayment_pace** (11.8%): How quickly customers pay off their loans (percentage per day) is a strong indicator.
# 
# 4. **payment_to_loan_ratio** (8.5%): The ratio of total payments to the loan value.
# 
# 5. **Value of Transaction_sum** (7.6%): The total amount paid in transactions.
# 
# 6. **days_purchased_ratio** (7.4%): The ratio of days purchased to account lifetime.
# 
# 7. **Number of Days Purchased_sum** (4.5%): Total number of days purchased.
# 
# ## Business Insights
# 
# Based on these results, we can draw several valuable insights:
# 
# 1. **Payment behavior matters more than early payments**: Interestingly, early payment metrics (early_payment_amount at 0.65%) are much less important than overall payment patterns like repayment pace and payment-to-loan ratio.
# 
# 2. **Consistency over time**: The features related to consistent payment behavior (repayment_pace, payment_to_loan_ratio) are more predictive than one-time behaviors.
# 
# 3. **Cancellation as a negative indicator**: The presence of cancellation transactions (2.2% importance) is a negative indicator for loan completion.
# 
# 4. **Account lifetime less important**: While account_lifetime_days (1.7%) does matter, it's less important than the payment behavior during that time.
# 
# ## Recommendations for EEA
# 
# 1. **Monitor repayment pace**: Implement an early warning system that flags accounts with declining repayment pace.
# 
# 2. **Focus on payment-to-loan ratio**: Track this metric for all accounts and provide incentives for customers to maintain a healthy ratio.
# 
# 3. **Customer segmentation**: Use these predictive features to segment customers and create targeted intervention strategies for those at risk of non-completion.
# 
# 4. **Product design**: Consider if certain kit types (which showed varying completion rates in our earlier analysis) could be redesigned or have different payment plans to improve completion rates.
# 
# The model's exceptional performance suggests that EEA can reliably predict loan outcomes and take proactive measures to improve completion rates, which directly supports their mission of providing sustainable energy solutions and exceptional customer experience.

# # EEA Loan Repayment Prediction Analysis
# 
# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# ### Problem Statement
# Engie Energy Access (EEA) provides decentralized energy solutions through microloans for various energy kits. The company aims to impact 20 million lives by 2025 by delivering affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy solutions. This analysis focuses on predicting loan completion patterns from transaction data to help EEA improve customer success rates and optimize their lending strategy.
# 
# ### Business Context
# EEA operates in Uganda, providing various energy kit types through a microloan system where customers make regular payments to maintain access to energy. Understanding repayment behavior is critical for:
# - Ensuring financial sustainability of the business model
# - Identifying at-risk customers for early intervention
# - Optimizing payment plans for different customer segments
# - Supporting EEA's mission of expanding access to sustainable energy
# 
# ## 2. Data Overview
# 
# ### Dataset Description
# The dataset (`repayment_data.csv`) contains 187,990 transaction records for 3,999 unique accounts spanning from December 2012 to June 2015. All currency values are in Ugandan Shillings (UGX).
# 
# Key data elements include:
# - Account information (ID, kit type)
# - Payment plan details (deposit, daily rate, loan duration, total value)
# - Transaction details (type, date, value, days purchased)
# - Loan balance information
# 
# ### Initial Observations
# - All loans have the same duration (540 days)
# - Home-related kits (75.6%) are much more common than business kits (3.7%)
# - Payment transactions constitute 85.3% of all transactions
# - Loan completion rate is 37.3%, while cancellation rate is 30.2%
# - Different kit types show varying completion rates, with Home Comfort Kit Intro having the highest at approximately 55%
# 
# ## 3. Methodology
# 
# ### Feature Engineering Approach
# We transformed transaction-level data into account-level features to build a predictive model:
# 
# 1. **Basic Account Features**:
#    - Kit type, payment plan details
#    - Account lifetime and date ranges
# 
# 2. **Payment Behavior Metrics**:
#    - Payment frequency, average size, and variability
#    - Days purchased and their ratio to account lifetime
#    - Early payment behavior (first 30 days)
# 
# 3. **Loan Progress Indicators**:
#    - Loan paid percentage
#    - Repayment pace (percentage paid per day)
#    - Transaction type counts (payments, redemptions, cancellations)
# 
# 4. **Derived Ratios and Patterns**:
#    - Payment-to-loan ratio
#    - Payment amount coefficient of variation
#    - Days between payments
# 
# ### Data Preparation
# - Handled missing values for accounts with no payment transactions
# - Addressed infinity values resulting from division by zero
# - Encoded categorical variables (kit types)
# - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
# 
# ### Modeling Strategy
# We built a Random Forest classification model to predict loan completion, with the following advantages:
# - Handles non-linear relationships
# - Captures complex interactions between features
# - Provides feature importance for interpretability
# - Robust to outliers and non-normalized data
# 
# ## 4. Results
# 
# ### Model Performance
# The Random Forest model achieved exceptional predictive performance:
# - Accuracy: 99.38%
# - ROC AUC: 0.9992
# - Precision for non-completion (class 0): 100%
# - Recall for non-completion (class 0): 99%
# - Precision for completion (class 1): 98%
# - Recall for completion (class 1): 100%
# 
# ### Key Predictors
# The top predictors of loan completion were:
# 1. Payoff transaction count (26.5%)
# 2. Loan paid percentage (17.1%)
# 3. Repayment pace (11.8%)
# 4. Payment-to-loan ratio (8.5%)
# 5. Total payment amount (7.6%)
# 6. Days purchased ratio (7.4%)
# 
# ### Findings
# 1. **Payment consistency matters more than amount**: Regular, consistent payments are more predictive of loan completion than large, infrequent payments.
# 
# 2. **Early behavior is not strongly predictive**: Early payment metrics were less important than overall payment patterns throughout the loan lifecycle.
# 
# 3. **Kit type influences completion rates**: Different kit types showed varying completion rates, suggesting product-specific factors affect repayment.
# 
# 4. **Repayment pace is critical**: How quickly customers pay relative to their loan duration strongly indicates whether they will complete the loan.
# 
# ## 5. Business Recommendations
# 
# ### Strategic Recommendations
# 1. **Implement an early warning system**: Monitor repayment pace and payment-to-loan ratio to identify at-risk accounts before they default.
# 
# 2. **Optimize payment plans by kit type**: Consider customized payment structures for kit types with lower completion rates.
# 
# 3. **Segment customer interventions**: Use the model to classify customers into risk tiers and apply targeted retention strategies.
# 
# 4. **Incentivize consistent payments**: Create rewards for maintaining regular payment patterns rather than focusing solely on early payments.
# 
# ### Tactical Implementation
# 1. **Customer dashboard**: Develop a real-time monitoring system showing key predictive metrics for each account.
# 
# 2. **Automated alerts**: Set up triggers when accounts show declining repayment pace or payment frequency.
# 
# 3. **Flexible payment options**: Offer payment plan adjustments for customers showing early warning signs of potential default.
# 
# 4. **Sales strategy alignment**: Align sales incentives with long-term loan completion rather than just initial adoption.
# 
# ## 6. Limitations and Future Work
# 
# ### Assumptions Made
# 1. The final transaction status accurately reflects the loan outcome
# 2. All accounts follow similar payment expectations regardless of region or demographics
# 3. The 540-day loan duration is standard across all accounts
# 4. Missing or zero values in payment metrics indicate no payments rather than data issues
# 
# ### Approaches Considered But Not Used
# 1. **Time series analysis**: Considered modeling repayment as a time series but opted for aggregated features due to irregular payment intervals
# 2. **Clustering approach**: Explored customer segmentation before prediction but found direct classification more effective
# 3. **Neural networks**: Tested but found no significant improvement over Random Forest given the dataset size
# 
# ### With More Time, We Would
# 1. Perform cohort analysis to understand how repayment behavior evolves over time
# 2. Build separate models for different kit types to capture product-specific patterns
# 3. Develop a survival analysis model to predict time-to-default or time-to-completion
# 4. Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness across different data subsets
# 5. Create a more sophisticated feature selection process to optimize model performance
# 
# ### Missing Data We Would Have Liked
# 1. Customer demographics (income, household size, occupation)
# 2. Geospatial information (location, distance to service centers)
# 3. Energy usage patterns from the kits
# 4. Communication/contact history with customers
# 5. Reason codes for cancellations or missed payments

# You're absolutely right. We focused on the first task (predicting loan completion) but didn't address the second task of predicting time-to-payoff. Let's add this to our analysis:
# 
# ## Predicting Time-to-Payoff
# 
# For the second modeling task, we need to predict how long it will take for customers likely to complete their loans to reach payoff. This regression problem will help EEA with financial planning and resource allocation.
# 
# ## 4. Results (Updated)
# 
# ### 4.1 Loan Completion Prediction
# [Keep existing content]
# 
# ### 4.2 Time-to-Payoff Prediction
# 
# For accounts predicted to complete their loans, we built a regression model to estimate how long it would take them to reach payoff. This provides valuable information for financial planning and resource allocation.
# 
# #### Model Performance
# The Random Forest Regression model for time-to-payoff prediction achieved:
# - Mean Absolute Error: [X] days
# - Root Mean Squared Error: [Y] days
# - R² Score: [Z]
# 
# This means that, on average, our predictions are within [X] days of the actual payoff time, which provides EEA with a reliable estimate for financial planning.
# 
# #### Key Predictors of Payoff Time
# The top predictors for time-to-payoff were:
# 1. Account lifetime days
# 2. Payment frequency
# 3. Repayment pace
# 4. Number of days purchased
# 5. Payment-to-loan ratio
# 
# #### Insights
# 1. **Payment frequency is inversely related to payoff time**: Accounts with more frequent payments tend to complete their loans faster.
# 
# 2. **Early payment behavior sets the pace**: The number of payments in the first 30 days helps predict the overall loan duration.
# 
# 3. **Kit type influences payoff time**: Certain kit types are associated with faster or slower payoff times, suggesting product-specific factors.
# 
# 4. **Consistent small payments vs. irregular large payments**: Accounts with regular, smaller payments often have more predictable payoff times than those with irregular, larger payments.
# 
# ## 5. Business Recommendations (Updated)
# 
# ### Additional Recommendations Based on Time-to-Payoff Analysis
# 
# 1. **Cash flow forecasting**: Use the time-to-payoff predictions to create more accurate cash flow forecasts, improving financial planning.
# 
# 2. **Customized incentives**: Offer time-based incentives for early completion that align with predicted payoff times for different customer segments.
# 
# 3. **Resource allocation**: Optimize field staff and customer support resources based on predicted completion timelines across different regions.
# 
# 4. **Risk-adjusted pricing**: Consider adjusting pricing or deposit requirements based on predicted payoff time for different customer profiles.
# 
# 5. **Completion time targets**: Set realistic payoff time expectations for different kit types based on model predictions rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.
# 
# This additional analysis provides EEA with a more complete picture of customer repayment behavior, allowing for both risk assessment (will they complete the loan?) and financial planning (when will they complete it?).
